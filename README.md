### Ex3 Project 

*I will brief the project every part of the brief will get most explanation in the wiki pages.*

This illustration exhibit all the classes and their dependencies.

Tthe three classes is the **DiGraph** and **GraphAlgo**.

The **Node** represent single node in graph, for every node have special key, and all her neighbors.

The **Graph** class complicated from Node and Edge, in the class the node of the graph and the edges keep in two different hashmap. 
You can operate sum operation on teh graph, you can removeNode, you can AddNode , you can conncet between two nodes and put weight for the edge.

The **Graph Algo** class composed of graph class, you need to initial the class with graph, and you can operate on her some operation.

In this class you can find the shortestpath from src to other destination, you can check if the graph is connectively,
you can export Json file of the graph that contain all the edges and the nodes of the graph. you can too read Json file and load the class with him.
